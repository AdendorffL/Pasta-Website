        <h2>1. Spaghetti</h2>
        <img
          class="pasta-type"
          src="../Resources/images/spaghetti.png"
          alt="Spaghetti Image"
        />
        <p>
          I highly recommend spaghetti, possibly the most recognizable pasta,
          with tomato and basil sauce, carbonara, or seafood - as long as you do
          not break it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've put your perfectly pristine, unbroken spaghetti into the
          boiling water, adjust the salt based on the dish you're making.I
          suggest keeping the water salt-free if you're pairing the spaghetti
          with an already heavily-seasoned sauce like pesto, but adding some
          salt when making a cheese or simple tomato sauce.

        <h2>2. Penne Rigate</h2>
        <img
          class="pasta-type"
          src="../Resources/images/penne.png"
          alt="Penne Rigate Image"
        />
        <p>
          One of my favorite things about penne is its versatility: I favor it
          with a four-cheese sauce with sausage or meat. I love the fact that
          penne are hollow as that helps them collect and hold sauce very well.

        <h2>3. Fusilli</h2>
        <img
          class="pasta-type"
          src="../Resources/images/fusilli.png"
          alt="Fusilli Image"
        />
        <p>
          Fusilli is for one thing and one thing only: You can only make fusilli
          with pesto. Any other way is a waste of time. I would suggest using a
          pesto that has a lot of pine nuts. The pine nuts fit perfectly between
          the curls, and the greens of the pesto fill the gaps in the pasta.

        <h2>4. Orecchiette</h2>
        <img
          class="pasta-type"
          src="../Resources/images/orecchiette.png"
          alt="Orecchiette Image"
        />
        <p>
          The shape of orecchiette, or "little ears" in Italian, is perfect for
          holding chunky, creamy sauces. I highly recommend it with sausage and
          chopped broccoli.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Rigatoni</h2>
        <img
          class="pasta-type"
          src="../Resources/images/rigatoni.png"
          alt="Rigatoni Image"
        />
        <p>
          Rigatoni is one of my favorite types of pasta because it uses the same
          principle as penne, but they are wider so they're perfect for chunkier
          dishes with things like diced pancetta and diced tomatoes.
